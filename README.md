# ATM-project

This was a group project for a OOP -course.

All the participants in this project, have been written in the main.py docstring.

When you start the program, you are greeted with a PIN -window. 
Once you have entered the correct PIN code, you will be able to move to the next page, where you can look at your balance, deposit or withdrawing a certain amount of "money" by pressing buttons. 
Whether you withdraw or deposit "money" into your account, it will be updated into the .txt -file. If you close the program, the balance will stay the same amount as you left it in the .txt -file
