<h2> How is works </h2>

When you start the program, you are greeted with a PIN -window.

Once you have entered the correct PIN code, you will be able to move to the next page, where you can look at your balance, deposit or withdrawing a certain amount of "money" by pressing buttons. If you enter an incorrect PIN, you will be given an error.

Whether you withdraw or deposit "money" into your account, it will be updated into the .txt -file. If you close the program, the balance will stay the same amount as you left it in the .txt -file
